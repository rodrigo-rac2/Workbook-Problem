Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters. Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

There are  chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from  to .
The  chapter has  problems, numbered from  to .
Each page can hold up to  problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than  problems.
Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
The page number indexing starts at .
Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?

Example

Lisa's workbook contains  problems for chapter , and  problems for chapter . Each page can hold  problems.

The first page will hold  problems for chapter . Problem  is on page , so it is special. Page  contains only Chapter , Problem , so no special problem is on page . Chapter  problems start on page  and there are  problems. Since there is no problem  on page , there is no special problem on that page either. There is  special problem in her workbook.

Note: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.
